# Hi, I'm Mehul! 👋

I'm a product builder based in Singapore, making tools for the AI age. I love creating extensions that improve developer workflows and exploring data analytics.

### 🚀 What I'm Building
* **[SQL Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mehul.sql-preview)**: Data analysis extension in Cursor / Claude Desktop for collaborative work between LLMs and Humans !
  - Connects to Trino and works with Local Files like csv and parquet
  - Built in MCP server with data preview capabilities, avoids overloading LLM context window
  - SQL for everything, analyse local files as well as your databases using SQL
